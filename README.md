# PHP OOP

This is a basic project that uses Object Oriented Programming and its principles to demonstrate the great features and benefits in OOP.

The project aims to include as many PHP OOP concepts as possible, the following are some of these.

Although there are many external libraries available that enforce DRY (**D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself) and Don't Reinvent the Wheel, the aim is to focus on a simple project based on OOP without use of much of the available packages out of the box. 

- **Classes**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces** (Polymorphism)
- **Traits**
- **Exceptions** (To better control errors)
- **Namespacing & Autoloading** (PSR standards)
- **Unit Testing** (TDD using the popular PHPUnit tool)

## Installation
To install this small project, you should first ensure that you have the Composer Dependency Manager and a compatible PHP version installed.

Ideally the .gitignore file would exclude vendor packages, credentials, tests, etc. For the purpose of demonstration some of these 
may be included.

Clone the repository to a suitable directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rachow/oop.git
```
